## R trading homework

### SPX_n-period_range_study.r
This script is used to examine the range of S&P 500 index over the course of "n" (usually 20 trading days, or approximately 1 month)

30 day range percentiles on SPX since 1-1-2000

|    70%     80%     90%     95%   99.5% |
| 7.7000  9.1000 12.2000 15.3000 28.0815 |

### RUT_n-period_range_study.r
Same thing as above, except analysis on the Russell 2000 rather than the S&P

30 day range percentiles on RUT since 1-1-2000

|   70%    80%    90%    95%  99.5% |
|10.100 11.500 14.530 17.900 34.089 |


See the XLSX files in the output folder for formatted output of these scripts (they write CSVs, confitional formatting, etc. was done after the fact in Excel)
